A simplest programs to start C programming Description: This C program implements a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It effectively demonstrates the usage of fundamental programming constructs including input/output functions, conditional statements (if-else), variables, and user interaction.

Upon execution, the program displays a message introducing its functionality. It then prompts the user to input two numbers and choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) using the scanf function. The program uses a series of if-else statements to perform the selected operation and display the result.

By incorporating these elements, the program provides a clear illustration of how to create a basic interactive calculator using C, making it an instructive example for learning about essential C programming concepts.
